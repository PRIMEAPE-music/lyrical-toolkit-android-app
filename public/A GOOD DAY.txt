Wake up to the rising sun,
the dogs cuddled up to me and my love, give a kiss and get up, 
As soon as im dressed they ready to run, strap in the kids,
i cant help but grin, they losin their shit for the fun,

enter the world granted with bliss, blessed to exist,
nose to the wind, the air crisp, slightly adrift, 
the light warm, bright, adorn me with life to persist
enjoy the sight, the boys excited delight they emit,

Circle back to the crib, make em sit to go in,
have a treat, cuz im proud that they did,
go lay down with your mom, its time for me to login,
start the pot, coffee hot, puffin zen and get it on,

im either makin beats or writin to em,
lifes complete when you seek a pursuit,
mine is music and i cant help but to do it,
practice and craftin, invent and produce,
the movement conducive and true,

this as good as it gets, the progression immense, 
diffusin the stress, unkempt and a mess,
it dont matter i dont care bout the rest,
just keep doin my best and enjoy it no less,
no regrets or contempt to digress,

Instead of a walk boys lets get to the park, play with the dogs, 
they just want the ball, toss and a brawl, chase and restart,
Make haste with it all, take too long and they bark, 
like hey Pa come on, come on, do your part,

Again it's back to the house, they lousin around, 
pantin aloud, lay down by the fan, happy and proud,
for me its back to the plan, thats a command, 
raisin the sound, creation demands, takin a stand,
ten toes on the ground, 

the momentum relentless, compounds and compresses,
the data enters the senses and ends with expression,
the concepts stuck in my head and plottin to exit,
no profit incentive, the penmanship offers contentment,
thats the ascension, the process intent on invention,

i gotta make somethin before im dead and forgotten,
some contribution to the art that i lauded,
its the only true honor i ever really wanted, 
and it's all that I got, only hope to help to alter the plot,

the wheel never stops lately, just want back in the lab,
but its time to chill with the lady, kick back and relax,
lay down with the fam and leave the mind in the past to unpack,
log off for the night, it's been a good day, I'll leave it at that.
